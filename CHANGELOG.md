## [1.1.8] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- **Authentication**: Updated email/password authentication to match Skylight's current web OAuth flow. The server now follows the browser login sequence (`/oauth/authorize` -> `/auth/session` -> `/oauth/token`) and uses the returned bearer token for API requests.

### Changed

- Centralized shared API constants, including the Skylight API version header
- Updated auth-related docs and error guidance to reflect OAuth-based login
- Added automated tests for the OAuth login flow and kept live smoke validation against the real API

## [1.1.7] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed

- **Authentication**: Fixed email/password authentication to use correct `Basic base64(userId:token)` format instead of `Bearer token`. The Skylight API requires the user ID and token to be combined and base64-encoded for Basic auth.
- **Calendar Events**: Fixed `get_calendar_events` returning no events when querying a single day. The API treats `date_max` as exclusive, so we now add 1 day to ensure events on the end date are included.

### Changed

- Added debug logging for authentication flow to help troubleshoot login issues
- Added automatic retry on 401 errors for email/password auth (attempts re-login once before failing)

## [1.1.6] - 2025-12-29

- Initial public release
